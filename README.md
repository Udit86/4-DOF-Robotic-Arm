# 4-DOF-Robotic-Arm
A Computer- vision based 4 DOF robotic Arm
The Robotic Arm is designed to seperate objects of same colour from a lot of differently coloured objects. 

Steps to run the project after assembling the Robotic- Arm chassis :
1. Upload the "main_arduino.ino" code on the Arduino board.
2. Change the webcam url and the serial port name in "object_detection.py" file in the lines 22 and 9 respectively.
3. Run the "object_detection.py" file and enter the colour you want to seperate out.
